Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?


Artemis Financial is a consulting company. They develop individual financial plans for their customers. There are several different kinds of plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The client wanted to modernize their operations, and furthermore keep their software security modern and up to date as well. They have a RESTful API, and came to Global Rain for their knowledge and assistance on implementing properly updated security. When I discovered and documented the security vulnerabilities I found, I supplied a detailed description of each one. It's vital to code securely and mitigate vulnerabilities such as these to properly protect both the company and the client. This increases client trust and loyalty, further encouraging a company's successs as a result.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?


I struggled the most with comprehending the dependency check report, as I had never previously interacted with one before. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?


I was able to increase security by updating to the latest/recommended versions for each vulnerability.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


After I refactored the code, I checked for new vulnerabilities by reading through the newest report and manually verifying there were no new vulnerabilities present. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?


In the future, I will be able to utilize Maven and its many features much more confidently. This will assist me greatly in the future for identifying security concerns. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?


From this assignment, I would provide my code after refactoring and my security vulnerability assessment report.
